==Define new Diagram Layers==
===Using VPDSL===

Diagram layers can be defined using VPDSL

Diagram layers are defined the .diagram.vptext file of the VPDSL plugin

See [[../help/topic/org.polarsys.capella.studio.doc/html/extension/viewpointdevelopment.html|Viewpoint Development]] page for more information.


===Using Sirius odesign files===

Diagram layers and new diagrams can also be defined using Sirius odesign files.
<br>
One can define odesign files from scratch, or use VPDSL to initialize a first version of the odesign file and then modify it directly.
<br>
When defining a diagram in the .spec.vptext file of VPDSL plugin, VPDSL will generate a plugin ending with .design.
<br>
This plugin contains an odesign file in the folder description.
<br> 
To know more about definition of odesign files, please have a look at the embedded help in Help / Help Contents / Sirius, or have a look at Sirius online resources:
