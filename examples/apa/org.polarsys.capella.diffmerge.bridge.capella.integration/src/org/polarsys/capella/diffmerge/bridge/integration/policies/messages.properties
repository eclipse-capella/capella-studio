ConfigurableMatchPolicy_Structure_Children_Description=Match elements that have the same container and cannot be confused with other siblings (more general than "Match unique children").
ConfigurableMatchPolicy_Structure_Children_Name=Match unambiguous children
ConfigurableMatchPolicy_Semantics_DefaultContents_Description=When a new model is being created, it is usually filled with default model elements: match these default elements if present.\nIt may only work if the top-level elements of the models match (see "Structure - Match unambiguous roots").
ConfigurableMatchPolicy_Semantics_DefaultContents_Name=Match default model contents
ConfigurableMatchPolicy_Structure_Roots_Description=Match root elements that cannot be confused with others.
ConfigurableMatchPolicy_Structure_Roots_Name=Match unambiguous roots
ConfigurableMatchPolicy_Structure_UniqueChildren_Description=Match elements that have the same container and play the same discriminating role within it.
ConfigurableMatchPolicy_Structure_UniqueChildren_Name=Match unique children
DecoratedCapellaComparisonMethodFactory_Links_Name=Capella Exchanges/Links: Name according to ends
DecoratedCapellaComparisonMethodFactory_Links_Description=Take into account the ends of Exchanges or Links to name them.\nExchanges or links that have the same name but connect different elements will thus be distinguished.
DecoratedCapellaComparisonMethodFactory_TechnicalElements_Name=Match equivalent technical elements
DecoratedCapellaComparisonMethodFactory_TechnicalElements_Description=Certain elements are purely technical and usually invisible to model users: for example, allocations of Capella functions to components.\nMatch such elements according to their meaning: for example, match allocations of the same function to the same component.
